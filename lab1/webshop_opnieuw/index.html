                            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
                            unknown
                            printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
                            not
                            only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                            unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                            Lorem
                            Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                            including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                            roots
                            in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                            McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
                            more
                            obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
                            the
                            word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
                            sections
                            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
                            Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
                            during
                            the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a
                            line in section 1.10.32.</p>

                            readable
                            content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has
                            a
                            more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
                            here',
                            making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
                            now
                            use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
                            many
                            web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
                            accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                            majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words
                            which
                            don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you
                            need
                            to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem
                            Ipsum
                            generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
                            first
                            true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with
                            a
                            handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
                            generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
                            non-characteristic words etc.</p>
